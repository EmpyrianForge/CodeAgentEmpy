# 🤖 AI Code Agent (Work in Progress)

A Python-based AI agent that can read, analyze, and modify code using the Google Gemini API.

## ⚠️ WARNING: NOT SAFE FOR PRODUCTION USE

**This project is experimental and NOT ready for use on real codebases!**

- The agent can modify and delete files without confirmation
- No safety mechanisms or rollback features implemented yet
- May produce unexpected or destructive changes
- Use only in isolated test environments with version control

## 🚧 Current Status

This project is under active development as part of the Boot.dev course. Core functionality exists but lacks essential safety features.

## 🎯 What it does

- Reads and analyzes Python code files
- Uses Google Gemini API for code understanding
- Can execute code and analyze output
- Implements function calling and agent loops
- Attempts to find and fix bugs autonomously

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Google Gemini API
- CLI interface
